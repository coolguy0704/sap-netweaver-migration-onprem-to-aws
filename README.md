# sap-netweaver-migration-simulated-onprem-to-aws
This project can be used to migrate SAP NetWeaver deployments from on-premises (simulated) to AWS. By launching an EC2 instance, simulating the deployment, and creating an OVA file, AMI, and EBS snapshot, organizations can take advantage of AWS's scalability, reliability, and security.
